# Inclusive Design Principles

This system must be usable by non-technical users with varying literacy levels and potential language barriers. The design should preserve dignity and support optional participation in any tracking features.

## Inclusion Goals
- **Minimal literacy assumptions**
  - Use clear labels, predictable structure, and simple language.
  - Avoid dense text blocks and complicated instructions.

- **Language and comprehension support**
  - Use familiar terms and consistent phrasing across the system.
  - Avoid jargon and abbreviations unless they are already used in the business.

- **Error prevention as dignity**
  - Preventing mistakes protects users from embarrassment, blame, and billing disputes.
  - Provide helpful prompts (“This field is required”) rather than punitive messaging.

- **Consent and opt-out**
  - If future enhancements such as location confirmation are explored, users must have clear consent and the ability to opt out.
  - The system should not require advanced technology use beyond basic form completion.

## Why This Matters
An inclusive design reduces training barriers, supports workforce diversity, and helps the business maintain accurate documentation while protecting trust and professionalism.
