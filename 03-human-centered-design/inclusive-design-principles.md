# Inclusive Design Principles

This system must be usable by non-technical users with varying literacy levels and potential language barriers. The design should preserve dignity and support optional participation in portal access or tracking features.

The system must also accommodate both facility-based scheduling and one-time or repeat individual/private-pay riders.

## Inclusion Goals

- **Minimal literacy assumptions**
  - Use clear labels, predictable structure, and simple language.
  - Avoid dense text blocks and complicated instructions.

- **Language and comprehension support**
  - Use familiar terms and consistent phrasing across the system.
  - Avoid jargon and abbreviations unless they are already used in the business.

- **Error prevention as dignity**
  - Preventing mistakes protects users from embarrassment, blame, and billing disputes.
  - Provide helpful prompts (“This field is required”) rather than punitive messaging.

- **Accessible guest intake**
  - Individual riders must be able to submit requests without creating an account.
  - The system must provide confirmation that the request was received.
  - Optional account creation may occur later to review ride history.

- **Consent and opt-out**
  - If future enhancements such as location confirmation are explored, users must have clear consent and the ability to opt out.
  - The system should not require advanced technology use beyond basic form completion.

## Familiarity as an Inclusive Design Strategy

For this system, inclusivity is achieved primarily through familiarity rather than novelty.

The existing paper intake form has been in use for years and represents a learned workflow for dispatchers and drivers. The digital version of the system must preserve:
- field order
- terminology
- grouping of information
- visual hierarchy

The only structural addition is a Requester Type selection (Healthcare Facility or Individual / Private Pay) to ensure correct tenant assignment and billing grouping.

This approach reduces training burden, lowers error rates, and respects the lived experience of non-technical users. Deviations from the paper form are treated as design risks rather than improvements unless they clearly reduce cognitive load.

## Why This Matters
An inclusive design reduces training barriers, supports workforce diversity, accommodates both facilities and individual riders, and helps the business maintain accurate documentation while protecting trust and professionalism.
