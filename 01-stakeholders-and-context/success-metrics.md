# Success Metrics

These metrics define what “success” means for the business and stakeholders. Metrics are stated in plain language and tied to workflow outcomes rather than technical features.

## Owner / Dispatcher Success
- Can view rides by day/week/month and quickly understand what is scheduled and who is assigned.
- Can confirm ride status without relying on paper.
- Spends less time reconstructing information for billing.

## Driver Success
- Can see an ordered ride list for the day.
- Can document each trip leg with required proof (time, mileage, signature) quickly and consistently.
- Experiences minimal friction and minimal new training burden.

## Billing Success
- Can group rides by facility and patient automatically for a billing period.
- Can track billing progress using statuses (e.g., ready to bill, billed) so work can be paused and resumed.
- Reduces retyping and manual sorting compared to the current paper workflow.

## Business-Level Success
- Billing turnaround time decreases compared to the current week+ delay.
- Cashflow improves due to faster, more organized billing cycles.
- Documentation quality improves, supporting trust and dispute protection.

## Out of Scope for Course Success
- Direct QuickBooks integration and full production deployment are not required for course success.
- A validated architecture, data model draft, and documented workflows are the primary outcomes for this capstone.
