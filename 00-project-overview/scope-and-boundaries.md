# Scope and Boundaries

## In Scope
- System architecture design
- Database and data model design
- Form and input design
- Multi-tenant scoping model (facility and individual)
- Implementation roadmap and planning

## Out of Scope
- Full system implementation
- Production deployment
- Live integration with billing software
- Advanced analytics or automation features

## Definition of Success
Success for this project is delivering a system design that could realistically be built after graduation and support:

- Healthcare facility billing workflows
- Individual/private-pay rider history and transparency
- Secure tenant isolation without shared “null” accounts
