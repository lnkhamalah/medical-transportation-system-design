# Problem Statement

## Business Context
A small, owner-operated medical transportation business relies on phone calls and paper forms to schedule rides and manage billing.

## Current Workflow
Ride requests are taken by phone and recorded on paper forms. These forms are used for dispatching drivers and later referenced for billing.

## Core Problem
The most significant challenge is the manual sorting and assembling of completed rides by patient and facility for billing, followed by retyping the same data into billing software. This process is time-consuming and delays invoicing.

## Impact
Billing delays create cashflow stress and unnecessary operational burden for the business owner.
