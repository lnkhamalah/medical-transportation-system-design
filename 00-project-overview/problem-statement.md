# Problem Statement

## Business Context
A small, owner-operated medical transportation business relies on phone calls and paper forms to schedule rides and manage billing.

The business serves both healthcare facilities and individual/private-pay riders. Requests may originate from facility staff, repeat patients, or one-time callers.

## Current Workflow
Ride requests are taken by phone and recorded on paper forms. These forms are used for dispatching drivers and later referenced for billing.

Individual/private-pay riders and healthcare facilities are handled using the same paper process, but billing and grouping differ depending on the requester type.

## Core Problem
The most significant challenge is the manual sorting and assembling of completed rides by patient and facility for billing, followed by retyping the same data into billing software. This process is time-consuming and delays invoicing.

Because both facilities and individual riders generate repeat trips, the lack of structured tenant grouping increases administrative friction and slows billing cycles.

## Impact
Billing delays create cashflow stress and unnecessary operational burden for the business owner.

Manual tracking also increases the risk of documentation inconsistencies, which can affect facility trust and private-pay rider transparency.
