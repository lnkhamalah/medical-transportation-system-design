# medical-transportation-system-design
Design and planning of a cloud-based, human-centered system to replace a paper-based workflow for a small medical transportation business.

This repository documents the design and planning of a cloud-based system intended to replace a paper-based workflow for a small, owner-operated medical transportation business.

The project focuses on system architecture, database design, human-centered form design, and project management planning. The goal is to improve scheduling visibility, billing preparation, and data organization while preserving familiar workflows for non-technical users.

## Project Status
Design and planning phase (no production system implemented)

## Key Focus Areas
- Human-centered and inclusive system design
- AWS-based system architecture
- Data organization to support accurate billing
- Scope-controlled project management and planning

## Background
The current workflow relies on phone calls, paper forms, and manual re-entry of data into billing software. The most significant challenge is assembling completed rides by patient and facility for billing, which causes delays and unnecessary operational strain.

This repository will be updated weekly to document design decisions, architecture artifacts, and planning materials.
