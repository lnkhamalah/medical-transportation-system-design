# Scope and Tradeoffs

This project is a design-and-planning capstone. Scope boundaries are explicitly defined to prevent overreach and keep the work feasible within a 10-week course.

## In Scope (Course Deliverables)
- Stakeholder analysis and workflow documentation
- Requirements definition (functional and nonfunctional)
- Human-centered design principles and usability considerations
- Conceptual system architecture (high-level)
- Data model design (entities, relationships, and form-to-data mapping)
- Security and ethics considerations (privacy, access roles, retention)
- Implementation roadmap with risks and tradeoffs

## Out of Scope (Not Completed During Course)
- Full production implementation of the system
- Direct QuickBooks integration
- Mobile app development
- GPS or automated location tracking (may be explored as future enhancement only)
- HIPAA compliance certification work (awareness will be documented, but not formal compliance)

## Key Tradeoffs
- Prioritize a simple, familiar form experience over advanced automation.
- Prioritize data accuracy and traceability over complex analytics.
- Document a buildable plan rather than promising a finished deployed product.
